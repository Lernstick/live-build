Debian Live Framework: make-live
================================

make-live is a utility to build Debian Live systems. It takes a Debian mirror as
an input and outputs a live system image (ISO image for CDs and DVDs, tarball
for netboot, or images for USB sticks). make-live is still in the early stage of
development, but has basic functionality and can be run successfully.
