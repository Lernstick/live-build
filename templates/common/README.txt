                     Welcome to the exciting world of 
                             Debian GNU/Linux! 

Intro
=====

   This is one of the CD-ROMs of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
   Debian is a very extensive collection of software. But it is more. It
   is a complete Operating System (OS) for your computer. And it is free
   (as in "freedom").

   An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that
   make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the
   kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer,
   which does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other
   programs. Debian is kernel independent. It currently uses the Linux
   kernel but work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels,
   using the Hurd. Most of the basic operating system tools come from the
   GNU project; hence the name GNU/Linux.

   Debian is available for various kinds of computers ("architectures"),
   like "IBM-compatible" PCs (i386), Compaq's Alpha, Motorola's 680x0
   (m68k), Sun's Sparc, Motorola/IBM's PowerPC, and (Strong)ARM
   processors. Check the ports page (http://www.debian.org/ports) for
   more information.

About This CD
=============

   This CD-ROM is labeled

     Debian GNU/Linux testing "Etch" - Official Snapshot i386 Binary-1

   which means that this CD is number 1 of 1 CDs containing programs
   ("binaries") for `i386' computers.

   The programs on the Binary CDs are ordered by popularity. The Binary-1
   CD contains the most popular programs and the installation tools; it
   is possible to install and run Debian with only the Binary-1 CD. The
   other CDs, up to Binary-1, contain mostly special-interest programs.

   The Release Notes for "etch" are available on the Debian web site.


Installing
==========

   Because Debian is a complete Operating System, the installation
   procedure may seem a bit unusual. You can install Debian GNU/Linux
   either alongside your current OS, or as the only OS on your computer.

   An Installation Guide for this CD is available from the Debian web
   site.

   Programs and other files that are needed for the installation can be
   found on this CD under

     /tools/ and   /install/floppy/

   For the impatient ones: you can start the installation program easily
   by booting off this CD-ROM. Note that not all (esp. older) systems
   support this.

   You can also examine the

     /install

   directory; you might be able to start the installation system directly
   from there.


Last-Minute Notes
=================

     * You should keep in mind that this is an unofficial CD of the
       current development version of the Debian system. This means that
       all sorts of bugs may be present anywhere in the system.



Using Apt
=============

   After installing or upgrading, Debian's packaging system can use
   CD-ROMs, local collections, or networked servers (FTP, HTTP) to
   automatically install software from (.deb packages). This is done
   preferably with the `apt' and `aptitude' programs.

   You can install packages from the commandline using apt-get. For
   example, if you want to install the packages `commprog' and `maxgame',
   you can give the command

     apt-get install commprog maxgame

   Note that you don't have to enter the complete path, or the `.deb'
   extension. `Apt' will figure this out itself.

   Or use aptitude for a full screen interactive selection of available
   Debian packages.


CD Manufacturers
================

   You are completely free to manufacture and re-distribute CD-ROMs of
   the Debian GNU/Linux Operating System, like this one. There is no
   charge from us (but of course donations are always welcome).
