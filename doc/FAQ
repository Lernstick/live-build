Debian Live: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
=============================================

Build Time
----------

Q: Is live-helper/make-live Debian specific?
A: live-helper supports Debian and Ubuntu right now. Adding automatic defaults
   for other Debian derivatives is easy - let us know about them and we may
   include it.

Q: How do I drop in to a shell during make-live chroot process?
A: Use "--interactive shell", then exit with 'logout' when you have made the
   setting changes you want and the build process will continue.

Q: Where to set the username or the hostname?
A: casper uses default username 'casper' and hostname 'live'. You can specify
   them by passing 'username=' and 'hostname=' as kernel parameters.

   live-helper automatically sets the username to 'user' and the hostname to
   'debian'. If you want to change this at build time, pass --username and
   --hostname to make-live, or alter LIVE_USERNAME and LIVE_HOSTNAME in
   config/image.

Run Time
--------

Q: What is the root password?
A: There is none set. You can switch to root with 'sudo -i' or set a password
   with 'sudo passwd'.

Q: What is the user password?
A: The password for the default user is 'live'.
