Download of prebuilt images
===========================

Although Debian Live is about creating your own customized Live system, we offer
some prebuilt images as well. Currently, builds for the three desktop
environments GNOME[0], KDE[1] and Xfce[2] as well as the standard system are
available. Builds based on testing are created every week and the ones based on
unstable are built daily. For stable, we update them when needed.

Currently, the following flavours are autobuilt here (.iso for CD/DVD images,
.img for USB stick images):

  * debian-live-${DIST}-${ARCH}-standard

    only packages of priority standard or higher and a few live specific
    packages (eject, file and sudo).

  * debian-live-${DIST}-${ARCH}-gnome-desktop

    the standard system, laptop related packages (laptop task) and the GNOME[1]
    desktop environment (desktop and gnome-desktop tasks).

  * debian-live-${DIST}-${ARCH}-kde-desktop

    the standard system, laptop related packages (laptop task) and the KDE[2]
    desktop environment (desktop and kde-desktop tasks).

  * debian-live-${DIST}-${ARCH}-xfce-desktop

    the standard system, laptop related packages (laptop task) and the Xfce[3]
    desktop environment (desktop and xfce-desktop tasks).

Note: Currently, we build images for lenny (aka "testing") and sid (aka
"unstable"). Due to the nature of unreleased Debian versions, it is possible
that no or not all images could be built because of uninstallable packages.
Please be patient then and wait for the next builds, use the previous, or do it
on your own by using live-helper. If you want something which works for sure,
use the etch (aka "stable") builds.
