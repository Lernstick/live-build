.SH BESCHREIBUNG
\fBlb clean\fP ist ein high\-level Befehl ("porcelain") von \fIlive\-build\fP(7),
der Debian Live Tool Suite.
.PP
.\" FIXME
\fBlb config\fP populates the configuration directory for live\-build. By
default, this directory is named 'config' and is created in the current
directory where \fBlb config\fP was executed.
.PP
.\" FIXME
Note: Currently \fBlb config\fP tries to be smart and sets defaults for some
options depending on the setting of other options (e.g. which linux packages
to be used depending on if a lenny system gets build or not). This means
that when generating a new configuration, you should call \fBlb config\fP only
once with all options specified. Calling it several times with only a subset
of the options each can result in non working configurations. This is also
caused by the fact that \fBlb config\fP called with one option only changes
that option, and leaves everything else as is unless its not
defined. However, \fBlb config\fP does warn about know impossible or likely
impossible combinations that would lead to non working live systems. If
unsure, remove config/{binary,bootstrap,chroot,common,source} and call \fBlb
config\fP again.

.SH OPTIONEN
\fBlb chroot_apt\fP unterstützt zusätzlich zu spezifischen Optionen auch alle
allgemeinen live\-build Optionen. Siehe \fIlive\-build\fP(7) für eine
vollständige Liste aller allgemeinen live\-build Optionen.
.PP
.\" FIXME
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\fP apt|aptitude" 4
defines if apt\-get or aptitude is used to install packages when building the
image. When building etch images, this defaults to aptitude. Every other
distribution defaults to apt.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-ftp\-proxy\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the ftp proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty but if the
host has the environment variable ftp_proxy set, apt\-ftp\-proxy gets
automatically set to the value of ftp_proxy.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-http\-proxy\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the http proxy to be used by apt. By default, this is empty but if the
host has the environment variable http_proxy set, apt\-http\-proxy gets
automatically set to the value of http_proxy.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-pdiffs\fP true|false" 4
defines whetever apt should use incremental package indices feature or
not. This is true by default.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-options\fP \fIOPTION\fP|\(dq\fIOPTIONS\fP\(dq" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to every apt call that is
made inside chroot during the building of the image. By default, this is set
to \-\-yes to allow non\-interactive installation of packages.
.IP "\fB\-\-aptitude\-options\fP \fIOPTION\fP|\(dq\fIOPTIONS\fP\(dq" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to every aptitude call
that is made inside chroot during building of the image. By default, this is
set to \-\-assume\-yes to allow non\-interactive installation of packages.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-pipeline\fP \fIDEPTH\fP" 4
sets the depth of the apt/aptitude pipeline. In cases where the remote
server is not RFC conforming or buggy (such as Squid 2.0.2) this option can
be a value from 0 to 5 indicating how many outstanding requests APT should
send. A value of zero MUST be specified if the remote host does not properly
linger on TCP connections \- otherwise data corruption will occur. Hosts
which require this are in violation of RFC 2068. By default, live\-build does
not set this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-recommends\fP true|false" 4
defines if apt should install recommended packages automatically. By
default, this is true except in emdebian mode.
.IP "\fB\-\-apt\-secure\fP true|false" 4
defines if apt should check repository signatures. This is true by default.
.IP "\-a|\fB\-\-architecture\fP \fIARCHITECTURE\fP" 4
defines the architecture of the to be build image. By default, this is set
to the host architecture. Note that you cannot crossbuild for another
architecture if your host system is not able to execute binaries for the
target architecture natively. For example, building amd64 images on i386 and
vice versa is possile if you have a 64bit capable i386 processor and the
right kernel. But building powerpc images on an i386 system is not possible.
.IP "\-b|\fB\-\-binary\-images\fP iso|iso\-hybrid|net|tar|usb\-hdd" 4
defines the image type to build. By default this is set to iso to build
CD/DVD images, for squeeze and newer it defaults to iso\-hybrid.
.IP "\fB\-\-binary\-filesystem\fP fat16|fat32|ext2" 4
defines the filesystem to be used in the image type. This only has an effect
if the selected binary image type does allow to choose a filesystem. For
example, when selection iso the resulting CD/DVD has always the filesystem
ISO9660. When building usb\-hdd images for usb sticks, this is active. Note
that it defaults to fat16 on all architectures except sparc where it
defaults to ext2. Also note that if you choose fat16 and your resulting
binary image gets bigger than 2GB, the binary filesystem automatically gets
switched to fat32.
.IP "\fB\-\-binary\-indices\fP true|false|none" 4
defines if the resulting images should have binary indices or not and
defaults to true. If set to none, no indices are included at all.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootappend\-install\fP \fIPARAMETER\fP|\(dq\fIPARAMETERS\fP\(dq" 4
sets boot parameters specific to debian\-installer, if included.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootappend\-live\fP \fIPARAMETER\fP|\(dq\fIPARAMETERS\fP\(dq" 4
sets boot parameters specific to debian\-live. A complete list of boot
parameters can be found, for etch, in the manpage of casper, for all other
distributions in the manpage of live\-initramfs. On the images, a list of all
parameters (without comments) is included in the /parameters.txt.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootloader\fP grub|syslinux|yaboot" 4
defines which bootloader is beeing used in the generated image. This has
only an effect if the selected binary image type does allow to choose the
bootloader. For example, if you build a iso, always syslinux (or more
precise, isolinux) is being used. Also note that some combinations of binary
images types and bootloaders may be possible but live\-build does not support
them yet. \fBlb config\fP will fail to create such a not yet supported
configuration and give a explanation about it. For usb\-hdd images on amd64
and i386, the default is syslinux. yaboot is only used on powerpc.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\fP cdebootstrap|cdebootstrap\-static|debootstrap|copy" 4
defines which program is used to bootstrap the debian chroot, default is
debootstrap. Note that if you set the bootstrap program to copy, then your
host system is copied. This can be useful if you want to convert/clone your
existing host system into a live system, however, make sure you do have
enough free space as this can, depending on your host system, get quite big.
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-config\fP \fIFILE\fP" 4
sets a custom configuration file for the boostrap programm of choice and is
empty by default. Refere to the documentation of debootstrap or cdebootstrap
for more information about that. When the bootstrap program is set to copy,
this has no effect.
.IP "\-f|\fB\-\-bootstrap\-flavour\fP minimal|standard" 4
defines if the bootstrap program should bootstrap the standard system (all
packages of priority required and important, which is the default) or a
minimal system (only packages of priority required, plus apt).
.IP "\fB\-\-bootstrap\-keyring\fP \fIPACKAGE\fP" 4
sets the archive keyring package to be used. Default is
debian\-archive\-keyring.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\fP true|false" 4
defines globally if any cache should be used at all. Different caches can be
controled through the their own options.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-indices\fP true|false" 4
defines if downloaded package indices and lists should be cached which is
false by default. Enabling it would allow to rebuild an image completely
offline, however, you would not get updates anymore then.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-packages\fP true|false" 4
defines if downloaded packages files should be cached which is true by
default. Disabling it does save space consumtion in your build directory,
but remember that you will cause much unnecessary traffic if you do a couple
of rebuilds. In general you should always leave it true, however, in some
particular rare build setups, it can be faster to refetch packages from the
local network mirror rather than to utilize the local disk.
.IP "\fB\-\-cache\-stages\fP true|false|\fISTAGE\fP|\(dq\fISTAGES\fP\(dq" 4
sets which stages should be cached. By default set to bootstrap. As an
exception to the normal stage names, also rootfs can be used here which does
only cache the generated root filesystem in
filesystem.{dir,ext*,squashfs}. This is useful during development if you
want to rebuild the binary stage but not regenerate the root filesystem all
the time.
.IP "\fB\-\-checksums\fP md5|sha1|sha256|none" 4
defines if the binary image should contain a file called md5sums.txt,
sha1sums.txt and/or sha256sums.txt. These lists all files on the image
together with their checksums. This in turn can be used by live\-initramfs'
built\-in integrity\-check to verify the medium if specified at boot
prompt. In general, this should not be false and is an important feature of
live system released to the public. However, during development of very big
images it can save some time by not calculating the checksums.
.IP "\fB\-\-build\-with\-chroot\fP true|false" 4
defines whetever live\-build should use the tools from within the chroot to
build the binary image or not by using and including the host systems
tools. This is a very dangerous option, using the tools of the host system
can lead to tainted and even non\-bootable images if the host systems version
of the required tools (mainly these are the bootloaders such as syslinux,
grub and yaboot, and the auxilliary tools such as dosfstools, genisoimage,
squashfs\-tools and others) do not \fBexactely\fP match what is present at
build\-time in the target distribution. Never do disable this option unless
you are \fBexactely\fP sure what you are doing and have \fBcompletely\fP\fI
understood its consequences.\fP
.IP "\fB\-\-chroot\-filesystem\fP ext2|ext3|squashfs|plain|jffs2" 4
defines which filesystem type should be used for the root filesystem
image. If you use plain, then no filesystem image is created and the root
filesystem content is copied on the binary image filesystem as flat
files. Depending on what binary filesystem you have choosen, it may not be
possible to build with a plain root filesystem, e.g. fat16/fat32 and plain
don't work as linux does not support to run on them.
.IP \fB\-\-clean\fP 4
minimizes config directory by automatically removing unused and thus empty
subdirectories.
.IP "\-c|\fB\-\-conffile\fP \fIFILE\fP" 4
using a user specified alternative configuration file in addition to the
normally used one in the config directory.
.IP "\fB\-\-debconf\-frontend\fP dialog|editor|noninteractive|readline" 4
defines what value the debconf frontend should be set to inside the
chroot. Note that setting it to anything by noninteractive, which is the
default, makes your build asking questions during the build.
.IP "\fB\-\-debconf\-nowarnings\fP true|false" 4
defines if warnings of debconf should be displayed or not. Warnings from
debconf are generally very rare and by default, we skipp them, if any, in
order to keep the build process entirely non interactive.
.IP "\fB\-\-debconf\-priority\fP low|medium|high|critical" 4
defines what value the debconf priority shoul dbe set to inside the
chroot. By default, it is set to critical, which means that almost no
questions are displayed. Note that this only has an effect if you use any
debconf frontend different from noninteractive.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\fP true|cdrom|netinst|netboot|businesscard|live|false" 4
defines which type, if any, of the debian\-installer should be included in
the resulting binary image. By default, no installer is included. All
available flavours except live are the identical configurations used on the
installer media produced by regular debian\-cd. When live is choosen, the
live\-installer udeb is included so that debian\-installer will behave
different than usual \- instead of installing the debian system from packages
from the medium or the network, it installs the live system to the disk.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-distribution\fP daily|\fICODENAME\fP" 4
defines the distribution where the debian\-installer files should be taken
out from. Normally, this should be set to the same distribution as the live
system. However, some times, one wants to use a newer or even daily built
installer.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-preseedfile\fP \fIFILE\fP|\fIURL\fP" 4
sets the filename or URL for an optionally used and included preseeding file
for debian\-installer.
.IP "\fB\-\-debian\-installer\-gui\fP true|false" 4
defines if the debian\-installer graphical GTK interface should be true or
not. In Debian mode and for most versions of Ubuntu, this option is true,
whereas otherwise false, by default.
.IP "\-d|\fB\-\-distribution\fP \fICODENAME\fP" 4
defines the distribution of the resulting live system.
.IP \-\-\fBdump\fP 4
prepares a report of the currently present live system configuration and the
version of live\-build used. This is useful to provide if you submit bug
reports, we do get all informations required for us to locate and replicate
an error.
.IP "\-e|\fB\-\-encryption\fP false|aes128|aes192|aes256" 4
defines if the root filesystem should be encrypted or not. By default, this
is false.
.IP "\fB\-\-fdisk\fP fdisk|fdisk.dist" 4
sets the filename of the fdisk binary from the host system that should be
used. This is autodetected and does generally not need any customization.
.IP "\fB\-\-grub\-splash\fP \fIFILE\fP" 4
defines the name of an optional to be included splash screen graphic for the
grub bootloader.
.IP "\fB\-\-gzip\-options\fP \fIOPTION\fP|\(dq\fIOPTIONS\fP\(dq" 4
defines the default options that will be appended to (almost) every gzip
call during the building of the image. By default, this is set to \-\-best to
use highest (but slowest) compression. Dynamically, if the host system
supports it, also \-\-rsyncable is added.
.IP "\fB\-\-hooks\fP \fIFILE\fP" 4
defines which hooks available in /usr/share/live/build/examples/hooks should
be activated. Normally, there are no hooks executed. Make sure you know and
understood the hook before you enable it.
.IP "\fB\-\-hostname\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the hostname of the live system.
.IP \fB\-\-ignore\-system\-defaults\fP 4
\fBlb config\fP by default reads system defaults from /etc/default/live\-build
when generating a new live system config directory. This is useful if you
want to set global settings, such as mirror locations, and don't want to
specify them all of the time.
.IP "\fB\-\-includes\fP \fIPATH\fP" 4
sets the path to the includes that live\-build is going to use,
e.g. additional minimal documentation that you want to have on all live
systems. By default, this is set to /usr/share/live/build/includes/.
.IP "\fB\-\-initramfs\fP auto|live\-initramfs|casper" 4
sets the name of package that contains the live system specific initramfs
modification. By default, auto is used, which means that at build time of
the image rather than on configuration time, the value will be expanded to
casper when building etch systems and to live\-initramfs for all other
systems.
.IP "\fB\-\-interactive\fP shell" 4
defines if after the chroot stage and before the beginning of the binary
stage, a interactive shell login should be spawned in the chroot in order to
allow you to do manual customizations. Once you close the shell with logout
or exit, the build will continue as usual. Note that it's strongly
discouraged to use this for anything else than testing. Modifications that
should be present in all builds of a live system should be properly made
through hooks. Everything else destroys the beauty of being able to
completely automatise the build process and making it non interactive. By
default, this is of course false.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-application\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the APPLICATION field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image and
defaults to "Debian Live" in debian mode, and to "Emdebian Live" in emdebian
mode, and "Ubuntu Live" in ubuntu mode.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-preparer\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the PREPARER field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image. By
default this is set to "live\-build \fIVERSION\fP;
http://packages.qa.debian.org/live\-build", whereas VERSION is expanded to
the version of live\-build that was used to build the image.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-publisher\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the PUBLISHED field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD image. By
default, this is set to 'Debian Live project; http:/live.debian.net/;
debian\-live@lists.debian.org'. Remember to change this to the appropriate
values at latest when you distributing custom and unofficial images.
.IP "\fB\-\-iso\-volume\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the VOLUME field in the header of a resulting CD/DVD and defaults to
\&'(\fIMODE\fP) (\fIDISTRIBUTION\fP) (\fIDATE\fP)' whereas MODE is expanded to the name
of the mode in use, DISTRIBUTION the distribution name, and DATE with the
current date and time of the generation. When running in debian\-release mode
however, it will instead default to 'Debian (\fIVERSION\fP) (\fIARCHITECTURE\fP)
live' where VERSION becomes the numerical version of the release being built
and ARCHITECTURE becomes the name of the architecture.
.IP "\fB\-\-jffs2\-eraseblock\fP \fISIZE\fP" 4
sets the eraseblock size for a JFFS2 (Second Journalling Flash File System)
filesystem. The default is 64 KiB. If you use an erase block size different
than the erase block size of the target MTD device, JFFS2 may not perform
optimally. If the SIZE specified is below 4096, the units are assumed to be
KiB.
.IP "\fB\-\-keyring\-packages\fP \fIPACKAGE|\(dqPACKAGES\fP\(dq" 4
sets the keyring package or additional keyring packages. By default this is
set to debian\-archive\-keyring.
.IP "\-l|\fB\-\-language\fP \fILANGUAGE\fP" 4
sets the language of a live system by installing l10n related packages. It
doesn't enable generation of the correct locales through setting the right
boot parameters, those need to be done through the bootappend\-live
parameter.
.IP "\-k|\fB\-\-linux\-flavours\fP \fIFLAVOUR\fP|\(dq\fIFLAVOURS\fP\(dq" 4
sets the kernel flavours to be installed. Note that in case you specify more
than that the first will be configured the default kernel that gets booted.
.IP "\fB\-\-linux\-packages\fP \(dq\fIPACKAGES\fP\(dq" 4
sets the internal name of the kernel packages naming scheme. If you use
debian kernel packages, you will not have to adjust it. If you decide to use
custom kernel packages that do not follow the debian naming scheme, remember
to set this option to the stub of the packages only (for debian this is
linux\-image\-2.6), so that \fISTUB\fP\-\fIFLAVOUR\fP results in a valid package name
(for debian e.g. linux\-image\-2.6\-486). Preferably you use the meta package
name, if any, for the stub, so that your configuration is ABI
independent. Also don't forget that you have to include stubs of the binary
modules packages for unionfs or aufs, and squashfs if you built them
out\-of\-tree.
.IP "\fB\-\-losetup\fP losetup|losetup.orig" 4
sets the filename of the losetup binary from the host system that should be
used. This is autodetected and does generally not need any customization.
.IP "\fB\-\-memtest\fP memtest86+|memtest86|none" 4
defines if memtest, memtest86+ or no memory tester at all should be included
as secondary bootloader configuration. This is only available on amd64 and
i386 and defaults to memtest86+.
.IP "\-m|\fB\-\-mirror\-bootstrap\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the debian package mirror that should be used to
bootstrap from.
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\-binary\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the debian package mirror that should end up configured
in the final image and which is the one a user would see and use. This has
not necessarily to be the same that is used to build the image, e.g. if you
use a local mirror but want to have an official mirror in the image. By
default, 'http://cdn.debian.net/debian/' is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\-binary\-security\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the debian security package mirror that should end up
configuered in the final image. By default,
\&'http://cdn.debian.net/debian\-security/' is used.
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\-chroot\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the debian package mirror that will be used to fetch
the packages in order to build the live system. By default, this points to
http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/ which may not be a good default if you live
outside the U.S.
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\-chroot\-security\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the debian security package mirror that will be used to
fetch the packages in order to build the live system. By default, this
points to http://security.debian.org/debian/.
.IP "\fB\-\-mirror\-debian\-installer\fP \fIURL\fP" 4
sets the location of the mirror that will be used to fetch the debian
installer images. By default, this points to the same mirror used to build
the live system.
.IP "\fB\-\-mode\fP debian|emdebian|ubuntu" 4
defines a global mode to load project specific defaults. By default this is
set to debian.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-root\-filesystem\fP nfs|cfs" 4
defines the filesystem that will be configured in the bootloader
configuration for your netboot image. This defaults to nfs.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-root\-mountoptions\fP \fIOPTIONS\fP" 4
sets additional options for mounting the root filesystem in netboot images
and is by default empty.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-root\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP" 4
sets the file path that will be configured in the bootloader configuration
for your netboot image. This defaults to /srv/debian\-live in debian mode and
to /srv/emebian\-live when being in emdebian mode, and /srv/ubuntu\-live when
in ubuntu mode.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-root\-server\fP \fIIP\fP|\fIHOSTNAME\fP" 4
sets the IP or hostname that will be configured in the bootloader
configuration for the root filesystem of your netboot image. This defaults
to 192.168.1.1.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-filesystem\fP nfs|cfs" 4
defines the filesystem type for the copy\-on\-write layer and defaults to nfs.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-mountoptions\fP \fIOPTIONS\fP" 4
sets additional options for mounting the copy\-on\-write layer in netboot
images and is by default empty.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP" 4
defines the path to client writable filesystem. Anywhere that
\fIclient_mac_address\fP is specified in the path live\-initramfs will
substitute the MAC address of the client delimited with hyphens.
.PP
.IP "" 4
Example:
.br
/export/hosts/client_mac_address
.br
/export/hosts/00\-16\-D3\-33\-92\-E8
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-cow\-server\fP \fIIP\fP|\fIHOSTNAME\fP" 4
sets the IP or hostname that will be configured in the bootloader
configuration for the copy\-on\-write filesystem of your netboot image and is
by default empty.
.IP "\fB\-\-net\-tarball\fP bzip2|gzip|tar|none" 4
defines the format of the netboot image. Choosing tar results in a not
compressed tarball, bzip2 and gzip in a bzip2 resp. gzip compressed
tarball. Choosing none leads to no tarball at all, the plain binary
directory is considered the output in this case. Default is gzip.
.IP "\-p|\fB\-\-packages\-lists\fP \fILIST\fP|\(dq\fILISTS\fP\(dq" 4
defines which lists available in /usr/share/live/build/lists should be
used. By default, this is set to standard. Note that in case you have local
packages lists, you don't need to list them here. Putting them into
config/chroot_local\-packageslists is enough (the filename needs to have the
\&.list suffix though).
.IP "\fB\-\-packages\fP \fIPACKAGE\fP|\(dq\fIPACKAGES\fP\(dq" 4
defines one or more packages to be installed in the live system. This is a
quick and convenient place to add a few packages when building an image
(limited by the max length of shell). Packages that should be permanently
installed should be put into a local packages list.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-repositories\fP \fIREPOSITORY\fP|\(dq\fIREPOSITORIES\fP\(dq" 4
enables one of available third\-party repository configurations in
/usr/share/live/build/repositories.
.IP "\fB\-\-root\-command\fP sudo" 4
controls if live\-build should use sudo internally to build the live
image. Note that this is not well tested and that you should, when relying
on sudo, call the individual live\-build command with sudo itself.
.IP "\fB\-\-use\-fakeroot\fP true|false" 4
controls if live\-build should utilize fakeroot and fakechroot to try and
avoid requiring root privillages where possible. By default, this option is
false.
.IP "\fB\-\-archive\-areas\fP \fIARCHIVE_AREA\fP|\(dq\fIARCHIVE_AREAS\fP\(dq" 4
defines which package archive areas of a debian packages archive should be
used for configured debian package mirrors. By default, this is set to
main. Remember to check the licenses of each packages with respect to their
redistributability in your juristiction when enabling contrib or non\-free
with this mechanism.
.IP "\fB\-\-security\fP true|false" 4
defines if the security repositories specified in the security mirror
options should be used or not.
.IP "\fB\-\-source\fP true|false" 4
defines if a corresponding source image to the binary image should be
build. By default this is false because most people do not require this and
would require to download quite a few source packages. However, once you
start distributing your live image, you should make sure you build it with a
source image alongside.
.IP "\-s|\fB\-\-source\-images\fP iso|net|tar|usb\-hdd" 4
defines the image type for the source image. Default is tar.
.IP "\fB\-\-symlinks\fP true|false" 4
defines if the symlink hack should be true or false. The symlink hack
converts all absolute symlinks to relative ones. By default this is false
and in general there is no need or gain to enable it. If you are in a
special situation that requires this, you will know.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslinux\-splash\fP \fIFILE\fP" 4
defines the file of the syslinux splash graphic that should be used instead
of the default one.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslinux\-timeout\fP \fISECONDS\fP" 4
defines the timeout the syslinux bootloader should wait for input from the
user at the bootprompt prior booting the default kernel. This defaults to 0
which means it will wait forever.
.IP "\fB\-\-syslinux\-menu\fP true|false" 4
defines if syslinux should be make use of the vgamenu capabilities or not.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysvinit\fP true|false" 4
defines if the sysvinit hack should be true or false. The sysvinit hack
disables all non\-essential services from starting up at bootup in order to
reduce overall boottime. By default this is false and in general there you
don't want to enable it.
.IP "\fB\-\-tasksel\fP aptitude|tasksel" 4
selects which program is used to install tasks. By default, this is set to
tasksel.
.IP "\fB\-\-tasks\fP \fITASK\fP|\(dq\fITASKS\fP\(dq" 4
defines one or more package tasks to be installed in the live system. This
is a quick and convenient way to get a reasonable default selection of
packages suitable for most users when building an image, but it results in
quite big images. If you want to have finer grained package selections,
local packages lists should be used instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-templates\fP \fIPATH\fP" 4
sets the path to the templates that live\-build is going to use, e.g. for
bootloaders. By default, this is set to /usr/share/live/build/templates/.
.IP "\fB\-\-virtual\-root\-filesystem\fP ext3" 4
defines what filesystem to format the root filesystem when building
virtual\-hdd images.
.IP "\fB\-\-virtual\-root\-size\fP MB" 4
defines what size the virtual\-hdd image should be. Note that although the
default is set to 10000 (= 10GB), it will not need 10GB space on your
harddisk as the files are created as sparse files.
.IP "\fB\-\-exposed\-root\fP true|false" 4
defines whether to expose the root filesystem as read only and not covered
by the union filesystem. This has useful implications for certain speciality
setups such as LTSP. By default, this option is false.
.IP "\fB\-\-username\fP \fINAME\fP" 4
sets the name of the account of the default user in the live system.
.IP "\fB\-\-win32\-loader true|false\fP" 4
.\" FIXME
defines if win32\-loader should be included in the binary image or not.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.\" FIXME
.\" FIXME
All command line switches can also be specified through the corresponding
environment variable. Environment variables are name LH_FOO, means,
e.g. \-\-apt\-ftp\-proxy becomes LH_APT_FTP_PROXY. However, this generally
should not be used.

.SH DATEIEN
.\" FIXME
.IP \fBauto/config\fP 4
.IP \fB/etc/default/live\-build\fP 4
.\" FIXME
An optional, global configuration file for \fBlb config\fP variables. It is
useful to specify a few system wide defaults, like LH_MIRROR_BOOTSTRAP. This
feature can be false by specifying the \fB\-\-ignore\-system\-defaults\fP option.
