.SH NAME
\fBlh testroot\fP \- Ensure that a system is built as root

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlh testroot\fP [\fIlive\-helper options\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBlh testroot\fP is a high\-level command (porcelain) of \fIlive\-helper\fP(7), the
Debian Live tool suite.
.PP
.\" FIXME
\fBlh testroot\fP simply checks to see if you are root. If not, it exits with
an error. Debian Live images must currently be built as real root.
.PP
.\" FIXME
Note: Support for using \fIfakeroot\fP(1) and \fIsudo\fP(8) internally in
live\-helper itself is still experimental, however, calling a helper yourself
with sudo is safe.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBlh testroot\fP has no specific options but understands all generic
live\-helper options. See \fIlive\-helper\fP(7) for a complete list of all
generic live\-helper options.

.SH FILES
