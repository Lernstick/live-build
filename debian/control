Description: utility to build Debian Live systems
 make-live is a utility to build Debian Live systems. It takes a Debian mirror
 as an input and outputs a live system image (ISO image for CDs and DVDs, or
 tarball for netboot). make-live is still in the early stage of development, but
 has basic functionality and can be run successfully.
